## Hi! I'm a co-founder and CTO at [Dashdoc](https://www.dashdoc.com/) building better software for the transportation industry.

Before this I co-founded [Truckfly](https://www.truckfly.com/) (acquired by Michelin in 2018).

Earlier I studied at [Ã‰cole Centrale Paris](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) and interned at [FreshPlanet](http://www.freshplanet.com) in NYC and [Smart Flows](http://www.smart-flows.com) in Paris. 


I love music, woodworking, graphic design, and programming.

You can learn more about me on [Github](http://github.com/cosmith) or [LinkedIn](http://fr.linkedin.com/in/corentinsmith/).
