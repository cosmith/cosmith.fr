# Dinner table

I'm making a dinner table with my wife.

I started with a parametric design in Onshape, you can find it [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/7ebe5c4a06aeced9cc09a95f/w/8eb007216d6580dd68c8c7d2/e/00a4c07e4f81d7b21377baa0?renderMode=0&uiState=65c7ac5a481d4f745b5b7882).

I found some nice ash hardwood not too far from my place, at [Scierie Rétif](https://www.scierie-retif.com/tarifs/planches/).

The first step is to do a rough cut of the wood into planks, and then to plane them.

We don't have a jointer but we do have a planer so we used the following method to get a straight edge:

- get a straight board to have a flat surface
- use hot glue to secure your board to the reference board
- plane both boards together
- since the bottom board is flat, your board's top surface will be planed parallel to it
- detach the board, flip it around and plane it normally

The next problem is joining the boards together. Without the jointer, it's not easy to get a square edge. The track saw is not precise enough to have a good 90° angle. So we finally bought a table saw!
